- Total number of possible paths in a directed acyclic graph
- Traversing the graph and counting the total paths in a depth first search is only feasible on a small n*n lattice graph.
- The solution is to backtrack the possible paths from incoming edge nodes. The base case starts with one possible path,
    - so when i=0; f(i) = 1
    - from there f(i+1) = sum of (map of incoming_edges[i+1] applied to f)
- First, a lattice graph based on size n*n is generated in a adjacency list, then the edges are reversed to produce an incoming edge list.
- Finally, the total paths at the destination node is counted by traversing the graph in topological order.

```rust
type AdjList = HashMap<i128, Vec<i128>>;
/*
Only able to move right and down to the bottom right corner.
How many such routes are there through a 20Ã—20 grid?
- its a dag
1 -> 2 -> 3
|    |    |
v    v    v
4 -> 5 -> 6
|    |    |
v    v    v
7 -> 8 -> 9

the solution is to backtrack the count,
you know
f(1) = 1
f(2) = f(1)
f(5) = f(4) + f(5)
f(9) = f(6) + f(8)
